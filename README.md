# Lift Logger 

Lift Logger is a SwiftUI-based iOS application designed for managing workout plans. It allows users to create multi-day workout routines by selecting muscles and exercises, then log their chosen exercises by day. This app integrates with an external API (via the `ApiHandler`) to fetch exercises for a chosen muscle group.
